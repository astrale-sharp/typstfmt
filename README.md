# Goals

- Decent output under any circumstances, anything not decent should be reported as a bug!
- Fast, Small, configurable and embeddable library and binary ! 

# State

It's not always pretty, but it should be lossless (handling comment is hard)

# Installing

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/astrale-sharp/typstfmt.git
```

## Setting up a pre-commit hook

You can set up a git [hook](https://pre-commit.com).

Every `git commit`, will then format automatically every .typ file before committing.

run:
```sh
echo "
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astrale-sharp/typstfmt
    rev: 1c414de
    hooks:
      - id: typstfmt
" > .pre-commit-config.yaml
```
to add a configured `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

you should then run:
```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

And your set up is done!

# Contributing
- feel free to open issue or discuss! I don't have github notifications so also feel free to go ping me on the typst discord server (@Astrale).
- once discussed, you may open a PR, not before cause I'm a bit chaotic and this is wip so things change fast and I would hate it if you lost your time.

# Architecture
## Main logic

Since we're visiting a AST (which is a tree) we have a recursive function
`visit(node: &LinkedNode, ctx: &mut Ctx)` that meets all the nodes in the tree.

It formats the children first (bottom up), then the parent decide what to do with their children.

Children have access to arbitrary context (they can know the kind of their parents, who are their siblings etc).

## Roadmap

Once the test suite is large enough and the formatting is satisfying, create an abstraction to make the codebase easier to work with.

# Testing and visualizing

## Installing Insta
We use insta! If you don't have it installed take a look [here](https://insta.rs/docs/cli/) (I advise installing with [cargo binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) since I have a small computer and don't like waiting for things to compile)

then `cargo binstall cargo-insta`

## Using insta here

### Can I see it in action?
to see how it currently formats all the snippets 
+ run `cargo test`, a failing test indicates one of the snippets displayed in the next step is not formatted like this anymore.
+ run `show_all.sh`

### Is that all I have to help me test?
Of course not! We have tracing enabled during tests!

If you're contributing tests you should add a test case under `src/tests` for instance: `make_test!(call_func_empty, "#f()");`

then running your tests: `cargo test && cargo insta review`

if the info log isn't enough, run `DEBUG=true cargo test`.
if you wish to pipe to a file run `NO_COLOR=true cargo test`
you may also set the `NOLOG` env variable if you wish to disable logging entirely.
